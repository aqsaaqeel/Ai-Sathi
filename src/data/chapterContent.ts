        measurement: `
      Chapter: Measurement
      Key Concepts:
      1. Length: Converting km to m, m to cm, and cm to mm. (1 km = 1000 m, 1 m = 100 cm).
      2. Weight (Mass): Converting kg to g. (1 kg = 1000 g).
      3. Capacity (Volume): Converting L to mL. (1 L = 1000 mL).
      4. Area and Perimeter: 
         - Perimeter of rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth).
         - Perimeter of square = 4 × side.
         - Area of rectangle = length × breadth.
         - Area of square = side × side.
      
      Example Problems:
      - Convert 5 km into meters.
      - Find the area of a rectangle with length 5cm and breadth 3cm.

        time: `
      Chapter: Time and Money
      Key Concepts:
      1. Time: Reading time in 24-hour format. AM and PM. Calculating time duration.
      2. Money: Converting Rupees to Paise (1 Rupee = 100 Paise). Operations with money (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Unitary method (finding the cost of one item from many, and many from one).
      3. Profit and Loss: Cost Price (CP), Selling Price (SP). Profit = SP - CP. Loss = CP - SP.
      
      Example Problems:
      - Convert 15:30 hours to 12-hour clock time.
      - If 5 pens cost ₹50, what is the cost of 1 pen?

        'human-body': `
      Chapter: The Human Body
      Key Concepts:
      1. Skeletal System: Bones, joints (hinge, ball and socket, pivot, gliding). Functions of the skeleton (support, protection, movement).
      2. Muscular System: Voluntary and involuntary muscles. How muscles work in pairs (contraction and relaxation).
      3. Nervous System: Brain (cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla), spinal cord, and nerves (sensory, motor, mixed). Reflex actions.
      4. Sense Organs: Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin. Care of sense organs.
      
      Example Questions:
      - What is the function of the skull?
      - How do muscles help bones move?
      - What are reflex actions?

        plants: `
      Chapter: Plants Around Us
      Key Concepts:
      1. Reproduction in Plants:
         - From Seeds: Germination (conditions needed: air, water, warmth). Seed dispersal (wind, water, animals, explosion).
         - From Other Parts: Stem cuttings (rose), leaves (bryophyllum), roots (sweet potato).
      2. Crops and Agriculture: Kharif crops (summer) and Rabi crops (winter). Stages of agriculture (ploughing, sowing, manuring, irrigation, harvesting).
